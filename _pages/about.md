Hi, thanks for visiting my website. I obtained my undergraduate degrees in Pure Mathematics and Computational Mathematics from the University of Chicago. Currently I am a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at UC Berkeley, working with Dr. Anne Collins in using trial-by-trial modeling of the reinforcement learning system to answer questions of how humans learn and generalize prior knowledge.
