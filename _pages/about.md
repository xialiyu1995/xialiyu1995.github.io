Hi, thanks for visiting my website! This site used [academicpages.github.io](https://academicpages.github.io/) as a template. It's still under construction, and I am gradually adding more contents.

My name is [夏](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%A4%8F) (last name: xià) [立](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%AB%8B)[宇](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%AE%87) (first name: lìyǔ). You might know me by Jimmy. Don't worry! You are at the right place. I go by Jimmy because it's just much easier for everyone. I would still appreciate it if you try to pronouce my real first name!

I obtained my undergraduate degrees in Pure Mathematics and Computational Mathematics from the University of Chicago in 2016. Currently I am a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at UC Berkeley, working with [Dr. Anne Collins](https://psychology.berkeley.edu/people/anne-collins) on using computational modeling and behavioral approaches to answer questions regarding how humans learn and generalize prior knowledge. Here is my [CV](https://xialiyu1995.github.io/files/liyu_xia_cv.pdf).

I use the word 'hierarchical' a lot, in the sense of [hierarchical reinforcement learning](https://thegradient.pub/the-promise-of-hierarchical-reinforcement-learning/) and [hierarchical modeling with STAN](https://mc-stan.org/).

If my work seems of interest to you, you should check out [our lab website](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~acollins/). If you are social justice minded, you should also check out [my husband's website](https://melendezrodriguez.com/).

Finally, here is a quote that I really like:

> We can only see a short distance ahead, 
>
> but we can see plenty there that needs to be done.
