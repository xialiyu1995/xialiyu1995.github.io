Hi, thanks for visiting my website! This site is a fork from https://academicpages.github.io/. It's still (obviously) under construction! And I am still learning markdown.

I obtained my undergraduate degrees in Pure Mathematics and Computational Mathematics from the University of Chicago. Currently I am a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at UC Berkeley, working with Dr. Anne Collins in using computational modeling of the reinforcement learning system to answer questions of how humans learn and generalize prior knowledge. I use the word hierarchical a lot, in the sense of hierarchical reinforcement learning and hierarchical modeling with STAN.


Here is a quote that I really like (also just to pratice different things in markdown):

> We can only see a short distance ahead,
