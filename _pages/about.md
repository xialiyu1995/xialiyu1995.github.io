Hi, thanks for visiting my website! This site is a fork from https://academicpages.github.io/. It's still under construction! And I am gradually updating the contents.

My name is 夏 (last name: Xia) 立宇 (first name: Liyu). You might know me by Jimmy. Don't worry! You are at the right place. I go by Jimmy because it's just much easier for everyone. 

I obtained my undergraduate degrees in Pure Mathematics and Computational Mathematics from the University of Chicago in 2016. Currently I am a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at UC Berkeley, working with Dr. Anne Collins on using computational modeling and behavioral approaches to answer questions regarding how humans learn and generalize prior knowledge. I use the word 'hierarchical' a lot, in the sense of hierarchical reinforcement learning (for a nice intro, see [here](https://thegradient.pub/the-promise-of-hierarchical-reinforcement-learning/)) and hierarchical modeling with [STAN](https://mc-stan.org/). Here is my [CV](https://xialiyu1995.github.io/files/cv.pdf).

If my work seems of interest to you, also check out [our lab website](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~acollins/).

If you are social justice minded, also check out [my husband's website](https://melendezrodriguez.com/).

And here is a quote that I really like:

> We can only see a short distance ahead,

> but we can see plenty there that needs to be done.
